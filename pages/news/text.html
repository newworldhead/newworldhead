<p class='p-3 tracking-wide text-secondary'>In New World there are 3 main areas in which your character will progress.
    You gain
    experience towards
    your overall
    character level and will level up once you gain enough XP. Upon leveling up you will be awarded attribute pointsthat
    can be used to increase one of 5 attributes in the game. You will also gain experience for each weapon type you
    use in the game, and upon receiving enough experience for a particular weapon you will be awarded with a weapon
    mastery point to be spent on either an active or passive ability within that weapon's skill trees. The final main
    progression of your character will come in the form of trade skills. Trade skills consist of gathering, refining,
    and crafting. </p>

<h3 class='text-5xl p-6 font-primary text-secondary'>Core Attributes</h3>

<p class='p-3 tracking-wide text-secondary'>As your character levels you will gain attribute points per level up to a
    total of 190 upon reaching the
    max
    character level of 60. You can also gain attribute points from gear. Upon visiting Aeternum for the first time your
    character will have 5 points in each of the core attributes. You can not drop below that 5 point minimum. </p>

<p class='p-3 tracking-wide text-secondary'>The points you earn while leveling your character can then be spent to level
    up your attributes, and
    those core
    attributes ultimately guide your overall build. How you spend those attribute points as you level will be crucial to
    your success in New World. As mentioned before, New World does not have a class based system so you have to make
    sure you tie your attribute points into the weapons you are wanting to use. </p>

<p class='p-3 tracking-wide text-secondary'>Strength increases the amount of damage you do with melee weapons. Some
    melee weapons scale exclusively
    from strength
    and other, lighter weapons scale primarily from strength and some from dexterity. </p>

<p class='p-3 tracking-wide text-secondary'>Dexterity is also the attribute that scales your damage with ranged weapons.
</p>

<p class='p-3 tracking-wide text-secondary'>Intelligence is the attribute you’ll want to spec into if you’re looking to
    gain damage from your magical
    weapons.
    It’s important to note here and very interesting that intelligence also provides increased damage for your pure
    magic weapons like the fire staff, and it also provides a damage boost to melee weapons that have a magical
    enchantment on them like a flaming sword for instance. </p>

<p class='p-3 tracking-wide text-secondary'>This isn’t going to increase the base damage of your melee weapon as that’s
    reserved for strength and dex
    as
    mentioned above, but will scale with the enchantment or magical perk that your weapon has.</p>

<p class='p-3 tracking-wide text-secondary'>If you’re planning on maining a healer, focus is the attribute you’ll be
    speccing into. </p>

<p class='p-3 tracking-wide text-secondary'>The last attribute is constitution, and it’s pretty straight forward.
    Putting points into constitution
    increases your
    overall health pool making you much tankier.</p>

<p class='p-6'>Each attribute also has attribute threshold bonuses. Attribute Threshold Bonuses give a persistent bonus
    to players
    for maintaining certain point values in each attribute. Bonuses are awarded every 50 points invested in a single
    attribute (e.g., at 50, 100, 150 points invested). Each threshold has a combat bonus and a non-combat bonus.</p>
